# Bias Aware Face Mask Detection Dataset (BAFMD)
We present a novel face mask detection dataset that contains images posted on Twitter during the pandemic from around the world. Unlike previous datasets, Bias-Aware Face Mask Detection (BAFMD) dataset contains more images from underrepresented race and age groups to mitigate the problem for the face mask detection task.
